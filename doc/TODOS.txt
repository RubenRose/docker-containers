        - Review program restarts and exit codes
    - XPaas Base docker image
        - Refactor /etc/profile environment variables
            - Instead of adding the "export" sentence in /etc/profile, add a custom script that exports them in /etc/profile.d

            Options:
            - On image build time, not on container runtime (which xml/profile file?)

- Fabric8 integration 
- Review OpenShift3 integration with docker
- Continuous build integration: On each new release, automatically generate the docker image (new tag) and upload to DockerHub
    - Create docker "JBoss XPaaS" account ant upload the images?
