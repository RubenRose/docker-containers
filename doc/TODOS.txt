- Docker images
    - Dockerfiles
        - Handle script errors
    - Supervisor
        - Create program groups
        - Execute jboss CLI files when jboss has started successfully using different approach than jboss-startup.sh control script (using supervisor events?)
    - XPaas Base docker image
        - Refactor /etc/profile environment variables
            - Instead of adding the "export" sentence in /etc/profile, add a custom script that exports them in /etc/profile.d
        - Export the docker container IP address ($DOCKER_IP)
                where DOCKER_IP=$(ifconfig eth0 | egrep '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}' | awk '{print $2}')
        - There are some yum errors during image build
        - When running sshd, a warning about internal IP address is shown
    - xpaas-jboss-appserver-docker
        - Config files (server profiles, users, roles, etc) + deployments into wildfly
            - via ssh
            - via shared volume
        - When running httpd, a warning about internal IP address is shown
    - BPMS docker image
        - Add jbpm-dashbuilder WAR
            - Add the dependency to kie-wb WAR (jboss-all.xml?)
        - Add custom context name for kie-wb as "kie-wb"?
        - Replace "standalone.xml" files for jboss-cli sh files ( to improve futures EAP/Wildfly version upgrades )
        - Clustering
    - BRMS docker image
        - TODO

- Fabric8 integration 
- Review OpenShift3 integration with docker
- Continuous build integration: On each new release, automatically generate the docker image (new tag) and upload to DockerHub
    - Create docker "JBoss XPaaS" account ant upload the images?
